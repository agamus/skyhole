    # TLS is the star of the show
    # at a minimum, the key/cert are required
    # i do not need to use the optional third argument as the 
    #   coreDNS docker image does use the CA certs from debian; they're backed in!
    ##
    # however, it appears that android devices really like the full certificate chain
    #   so we provide the full certificate chain
    ##
    # See: https://coredns.io/plugins/tls/

    # We use the $PIHOLE_IP environment variable to point coreDNS to the pihole
    forward . dns://{$PIHOLE_IP}
}

# Listen for plain old DNS queries
# forward them to cloudflare over TLS
##
# because the coreDNS container has no port 53 exposed outside of the
#   backend network, we can listen on 53 and know that only containers
#   on the backend network can reach us. E.G. Only piHole will be 
#   sending traffic to this listener.
